# Map

### Map Architecture

All of perception is structured as language. This is the Axiomatic Truth Principle (ATP), a concept that appears later in the map. Conscious of ATP, the question arises of how to create a language that captures phenomena beyond language. We must settle for failure in this regard, and commit the same sins of the philosophers and physicists who precede us. However, we can still think about how to create a language for understanding the universe. 

We have chosen a language that consists of Concepts and Operators. Concepts are signifiers that allow for the compression of knowledge. **say more about the compression of knowledge here**. Operators are logical rules that connect Concepts. 

When we use the word architecture, we are referring to the structure we are using to pattern the universe, to compartmentalize and understand it. **make this sentence more eloquent**

Why the use of Concepts and Operators as the fundamental structure of the map? There is one origin concept, the universe itself. **maybe make a note here about what the universe is for us. It is everything. Just to guard against somebody saying, "While what about the multiverse".** All other phenomena are embedded in the universe. The minimum architecture necessary to describe this one assumption is exactly the architecture we have chosen. To begin with the universe necessitates the Concept of the universe, and to claim that all other Concepts are embedded in the universe requires a logical statement of conditionality, an Operator.
