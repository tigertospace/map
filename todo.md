# Outline

### Introduction
* Brief overview of the motivation for the map.
* Make some joke about why this project is important. 

### Explanation of the language
* Explain the language (framework) that we use to design the map. 
* The map consists of Concepts and Operators. 
* Each Concept apart from origin concepts must have another Concept and Operator that precedes it. 
* Operators must relate to exactly two Concepts.
* Explain why this is language (framework) that we use (**I need help thinking through this.**)
  * We are trying to bridge mathematics (domain of languages that is fully falsifiable) with natural language. 
  * I am trying to think through why we have inherantly chosen Concepts and Operators. We never really discussed this, it just seemed natural. Why is this the case? 
* Admit that all of human knowledge is inaccurately structured as language (thus ATP) and that we are committing the same sin by creating this map. 
* Make some statement about why we create necessarily inaccurate languages that are not True even though we know this to be the case.

### Explanation of Concepts and Operators
* Start from the beginning (Tautology Origin Limit) and explain each Concept and how they connect via Operators.
